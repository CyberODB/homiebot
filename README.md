# homiebot

A discord bot for the homies.

Homiebot is the premier experience in multicloud aware enterprise grade shitposting.

## How to use

Probably don't. If you want to fork homiebot and do things to it be my guest, if you don't, look at the configs, register accounts on Azure, AWS, and GCP and activate instances for the services homiebot expects, of course remembering to populate some of them with data.

## How to contribute

Weep... Weep bitter tears. Then Fork this repo, make your changes, and submit a PR. There are no style guidelines, no unit tests, only strictly typed anarchy.
